# Customizing texts

Suppgram encapsulates all text generation in [TextProvider][suppgram.texts.TextProvider] class.

::: suppgram.texts.TextProvider
    handler: python
    options:
      show_root_heading: true
      show_source: false
      heading_level: 2

It has a lot of members, see [source code](https://github.com/Saluev/suppgram/blob/master/suppgram/texts/interface.py)
for details.

Suppgram provides out-of-the-box text packs for English and Russian languages. These texts are intentionally
bland to fit all more or less, so you should probably consider tailoring them to your needs.

::: suppgram.texts.en.EnglishTextProvider
    handler: python
    options:
      show_root_heading: true
      show_source: false
      show_bases: false
      heading_level: 2

::: suppgram.texts.ru.RussianTextProvider
    handler: python
    options:
      show_root_heading: true
      show_source: false
      show_bases: false
      heading_level: 2

If you want to customize your texts, you can either implement your own `TextProvider` or tweak an
existing one. For example, let's say we want to hide customer contacts from agents for some privacy reasons.
Our code would look like the following:

```python
# ./mytexts.py

from suppgram.texts.en import EnglishTextProvider


class MyTextProvider(EnglishTextProvider):
    customer_profile_contacts = "ðŸ“’ Contacts: (hidden)"
```

Then we can customize texts provider in all-in-one CLI:
```shell
python -m suppgram.cli.all_in_one \
    --texts mytexts.MyTextProvider \
    ...
```
or via builder:
```python
from suppgram.builder import Builder

from mytexts import MyTextProvider


builder = Builder()
...
builder = builder.with_texts(MyTextProvider())
```
